# Cats and Dogs Classification App

This project is a simple web application that uses a VGG16 feature extraction model combined with a logistic regression classifier to classify images as either cats or dogs. The app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- You should have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts, Python, and Streamlit.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cats-dogs-classification-app.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cats-dogs-classification-app
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Use the app to upload an image and click the "Classify" button to see if it's classified as a cat or a dog.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `vgg16_feature_extraction.py`: Python script for feature extraction using a pre-trained VGG16 model.
- `logistic_regression_classifier.py`: Python script for training and using a logistic regression classifier.
- `models/`: Directory containing pre-trained VGG16 model weights.
- `data/`: Directory where training data and model checkpoints can be stored.
